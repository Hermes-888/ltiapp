Dr. Taher Neurologist
Confirms Primary Progressive MS

He wants to use OCREVUS to supress the immune system.

My Re-myelination plan
I’ve been doing my homework, here are some links that determined my plan.

I plan to take mushroom extracts that strengthen immune response,  some of these are anti viral.
http://www.fungi.com/product-detail/product/host-defense-mycommunity-extract-4-fluid-oz.html
My Community contains 17 different medicinal mushroom species plus Lions Mane which has been shown to re-myelinate nerves.
Polysaccharides, especially β-glucan, are believed to be responsible for the biological activity observed in these medicinal mushrooms.
Phellinus igniarius ameliorated the severity of the EAE in MOG-injected mice, which was accompanied with reduction of demyelination, attenuation of microglia activation, and inhibition of infiltrating encephalitogenic immune cells. These results establish that the mushroom extract has potential therapeutic effects for MS.

This should get rid of viruses, boost the immune system and help re-myelinate damaged nerves.

STOP : nsaids - naproxen sodium All NSAIDS (even in low doses) cause major damage to the digestive track, liver and kidneys.
Add : 
Magnesium - Helps with sleep and bowel movement
zinc
Vit D3
Fish/krill Oil - Omega-3
Kombucha tea & fermented foods - Probiotics
Bone Broth - Trans Alanyl-L-Glutamine

Lecithin plays an important role in nerve cell nutrition and reduced levels were found in patients with multiple sclerosis. Lecithin is a basic component of the layer of myelin and the protecting sheath cells so if the amount of it decreases sever malfunctions in the body will occur.

http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/gut-microbes-could-help-trigger-multiple-sclerosis
They found that two bacterial groups, Acinetobacter and Akkermansia, were four times more abundant in MS patients than in individuals with no disease. Another group, Parabacteroides, was four times as abundant in healthy people.

http://scdlifestyle.com/2017/09/multiple-sclerosis-leaky-gut-connection/
Research shows us that repetitive activation of the immune system via a leaky gut contributes to the process of autoimmune diseases.

Interesting. Dont stop using Polacrilex Nicotine lozenges: 
Nicotine is an MOAI
https://selfhacked.com/blog/28-proven-health-benefits-nicotine-4-potential-risks/
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0107979
Our results show that nicotine ameliorates the severity of EAE (Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis), as shown by reduced demyelination, increased body weight, and attenuated microglial activation. Nicotine administration after the development of EAE symptoms prevented further disease exacerbation, suggesting that it might be useful as an EAE/MS therapeutic.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC404586/
https://www.sott.net/article/254745-Nicotine-The-Zombie-Antidote
Nicotine, the prototypical nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, counteracts inflammatory cytokine production and has demonstrated protective effects in blood poisoning. Nicotine acts as an anti-inflammatory and facilitates the creation of new brain cells!

    Check for hidden infections — yeast, viruses, bacteria, Lyme, etc. — with the help of a doctor, and treat them.
    Check for hidden food allergens with IgG food testing or just try The UltraSimple Diet, which is designed to eliminate most food allergens.
X    Get tested for celiac disease, which is a blood test that any doctor can do.
X    Get checked for heavy metal toxicity. Mercury and other metals can cause autoimmunity.
    Fix your gut. For details, see my blog on irritable bowel syndrome.
    Use nutrients such as fish oil, vitamin C, vitamin D, and probiotics to help calm your immune response naturally.
    Exercise regularly — it’s a natural anti-inflammatory.
    Practice deep relaxation like yoga, deep breathing, biofeedback, or massage, because stress worsens the immune response.
    Tell your doctor about Functional Medicine and encourage him or her to get trained — go to www.functionalmedicine.org for more information and to get a copy of the Textbook for Functional Medicine.

10/24/17
Dr. Taher
change in diet is helping 
started PT
Legs are very spastic/stiff first thing in the morning. no recommendations?

follow up in one month

10/27/17
Dr. Butaud
Legs are very spastic/stiff first thing in the morning. Try tizanadine at night?
discuss how to modify the immune system

PT update: switching to pool


10/25/17
Legs are worse than when I started the Nortriptyline
L knee is swollen but isnt buckling as much
I think the exercise bike caused problems with R hip and lower back
Hopefully the pool will help build strength

10/26/17
Worked 50 min in pool. It may have been too much, I had a hard time changing into clothesand needed help getting back to the truck.
rested with ice on knee. Felt much better by noon.
If hurting on Tues, do a treatment Else do a pool pass.
After fixing dinner and reaching the point that I cannot stand up anymore. I noticed I was sweating. I put an ice pack on my head to cool down as quickly as possible. Im not sure if the over heating is from inflammation or exertion.
Left leg is spasming tonight.
Maybe spend time cooling down after pool exercise. cold shower?
10/27/17
after breakfast, oatmeal with coconut oil, lecithin, Maple syrup and sunflower seeds. I noticed my head was sweating. 
Used ice pack for a half hour to cool down.
No over heeating after dinner. Had paleo stirfry

10/27/17 10:am

Paul Jensen - Alternative health center
196 S main Pleasant Grove
2:15 Fri. AMIT Muscle Activation
Im impressed. Dr. Jensen has worked with other MS patients and understands autoimmune problems.
He recommends:
Standard Process brand, Super EFF for nervous system support
https://www.standardprocess.com/Products/Standard-Process/Super-EFF
Super-EFF supports the central and peripheral nervous systems.
    Supports and helps maintain cellular health
    Provides precursors for energy production
Proprietary Blend: 516 mg Carbamide, Tillandsia usneoides, bovine liver fat extract, flaxseed oil extract. 
Spanish moss contains a compound that may help control blood glucose levels. The compound, 3-hydroxy-methylglutaric acid or HMG, is used as a major ingredient in several natural diabetic supplements.
Super-EFF contains both the vitamin F2 complex and the phospholipid factors important in the support of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Super-EFF also provides the precursors for necessary energy production.

and Neurotrophin PMG for Central Nervous system Support
https://www.standardprocess.com/Products/Standard-Process/Neurotrophin-PMG
Neurotrophin PMG is a Protomorphogen™ extract formula that supports healthy central nervous system function.
    Provides a unique profile of minerals, nucleotides, and peptides*
Proprietary Blend: 200 mg Porcine brain PMG extract and magnesium citrate. 
By combining the animal extract with magnesium citrate and calcium, the effects of this supplement should be noticed faster and people with cognitive conditions like Alzheimer’s or dementia should benefit from it.

Dr. Jensen said this should be taken on an empty stomach. It will keep the immune system busy instead of attacking the myelin.
His explanation of one cause of autoimmune disease is that when an injury occurs, sometimes the immune system is over-loaded with necrotic cells and becomes confused. (the sign accident in 2006)

2nd treatment 
Is neck adjustment causing this headache?

3rd treatment + Massage 11/8/ 1:pm
The massage was moderately painful. It seems Spring was moving energy through the damaged nerves in my legs or being relaxed caused the leg spasms to appear. Overall the massage was beneficial.
Making progress. Legs are getting stronger.
Walking more without the cane for balance.

Cause #3:
https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2017/09/408241/gut-microbes-may-influence-multiple-sclerosis-progression
For instance, the authors note that at least one of the bacterial species found in patients with MS produces molecules that mimic proteins found in myelin, suggesting that the presence of these bacteria could confuse the immune system into attacking myelin as well as the bacteria.


Beta Glucans
https://www.cancertutor.com/beta-glucan/
Technically beta glucan is an immunomodulator which helps make your immune system smarter.
Beta glucan is a safe all natural fiber molecule that scientists all over the world are researching. 
In fact, beta glucan is the most studied natural immunomodulator on earth.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-glucan
Oat fiber β-glucan at intake levels of at least 3 g per day can decrease the levels of saturated fats in the blood and may reduce the risk of heart disease.
The shiitake mushroom contains beta-glucans.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17895634
The healing and immunostimulating properties of mushrooms have been known for thousands of years in the Eastern countries. These mushrooms contain biologically active polysaccharides that mostly belong to group of beta-glucans. These substances increase host immune defense by activating complement system, enhancing macrophages and natural killer cell function.

I had a dream last night that we had a new weapon we were planning to use on North Korea. 
It is a satellite that targets and explodes the enemies bombs.
Game Idea?:


Massage and Muscle activation
I let them know my lower back and right leg have been sore all week. 
Hopfully it means the nerves are waking up.
Dr. Jensen said it sounded like part of the normal healing process.
Thurs: muscle stiffness and soreness. spasms made it hard to sleep.
Skipped swimming and made cookies instead.
I noticed it was hard to bend over to pick up items from floor or a low shelf
After dinner, Im noticing the internal heat again.

Fri: Had a good bowel movement. A while later I had diarrhea.
Skipped swimming and vit. P

Sat: No BM, ate well and had probiotic. 3 cookies. vit P
Sun: vit P. diarrhea again. is it the Flax seed in the cookies? or Crypto from the pool?

wed11/22: diarrhea again. Did a half hr. massage and felt better the rest of the day.
Drank clay with sillium husk for lunch. 
4pm: had sardines and bone broth jello. 
thurs: Thanksgiving
skipped PMG and only had Green tea. near lunch I had a banana and carrot juice.
3:pm gurgling intestine. seems slight ly swollem. no diahrea YET?

next time massage is with Emily 11/29 @9:45am

Resveritrol, a neurticeutical, contains Phytoalexin from the wine grape (Vitis vinifera) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Can increase NRG1 a protein that helps increase Schwann Cells.

https://selfhacked.com/blog/forskolin-everything-know-powerful-substance/
Forskolin supplement taken for obesity in obese and overweight men not only led to a decrease in body fat, but also increased testosterone levels and improved bone structure. study shows that these effects were connected to the increase of cAMP levels.
Cyclic AMP helps increase myelin, especially in the presence of NRG1. (schwann cells)
It is also known that cAMP can reduce inflammation by suppressing RAGE protein, which initiates the development of inflammation.
There is also a report showing that cAMP elevating drugs, including forskolin, are able to block production of potentially inflammatory protein GM-CSF.
Coleus forskohli extract was shown to be most toxic in cases where the animals were fed products with the high level of starch.
